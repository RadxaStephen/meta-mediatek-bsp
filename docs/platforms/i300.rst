i300 (MT8362)
=============

The `i300 platform <https://www.mediatek.com/products/smartHome/i300>`_ is
composed of the MT8362 SoC, the MT6392 PMIC, and the
:ref:`platforms/mt7668:MT7668 wireless chipset`.
The i300 platform is available in two packages
`i300A <https://www.mediatek.com/products/richIot/mt8362a>`_ and
`i300B <https://www.mediatek.com/products/richIot/mt8362b>`_.

i300A contains the same features as the i300B but also contains:

* an IMG PowerVR GE8300 GPU
* Display support (DSI and HDMI)
* Video Encoding (H.264) and Video Decoding (H.265 / HEVC) support.

The MT8362 SoC is also known as MT8167. The SoC is **only** referenced as
MT8167 in the source code.
