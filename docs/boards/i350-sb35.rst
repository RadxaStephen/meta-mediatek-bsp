i350 SB35 Board
================

The SB35 is a development board made by Innocomm.

Building
--------

You can build an image for the Innocomm SB35 board by setting the
`MACHINE` variable in your `local.conf` to `i350-sb35`.

.. code::

	MACHINE=i350-sb35

For full build instructions, please refer to the top level `README.md`.

Display
-------

The i350 SB35 support the `7-inch Raspberry Pi touch display`_.

If you wish to use the 7-inch Raspberry Pi touch display,
you need to add the following to your `local.conf`:

.. code::

	KERNEL_DEVICETREE_OVERLAYS_AUTOLOAD += " \
		panel-raspberrypi.dtbo \
	"

MT7663 wireless chipset
------------------------

The i350 SB35 board is integrating
a :ref:`platforms/mt7663:MT7663 wireless chipset`.

Device-Tree Overlays (DTBO)
---------------------------

The following Device-Tree Overlays are supported:

* `panel-raspberrypi.dtbo`: Raspberry Pi touch display (see :ref:`boards/i350-sb35:Display` section)

.. _7-inch Raspberry Pi touch display: https://www.raspberrypi.org/products/raspberry-pi-touch-display/

Audio
-----

Playback
^^^^^^^^

By default, the i350 SB35 board ouputs audio on the jack connector (headset).

It is possible to enable or disable this output. In order to do that, you will need to change several alsa settings using the following commands:

In order to disable the headset output:

.. prompt:: bash $

	amixer sset -c mtsndcard 'Audio_Amp_L_Switch',0 Off
	amixer sset -c mtsndcard 'Audio_Amp_R_Switch',0 Off

Capture
^^^^^^^

By default, the i350 SB35 board captures audio using the jack microphone.

The following command is an example that will start a mono record with a sampling rate of 48kHz and a signed 32bits bit format:

.. prompt:: bash $

	arecord -c 1 -r 48000 -f s32_le recorded_file.wav

It is possible to record using the 2 PDM mics present on the board instead.
In this case, the device will need to be specified explicitally as follows:

.. prompt:: bash $

	arecord -D dmic -c 2 -r 48000 -f s32_le recorded_file.wav
