i300A SB30 Board
================

The SB30 is a development board made by Innocomm.

Building
--------

You can build an image for the Innocomm SB30 board by setting the
`MACHINE` variable in your `local.conf` to `i300a-sb30`.

.. code::

	MACHINE=i300a-sb30

For full build instructions, please refer to the top level `README.md`.

Display
-------

The i300A SB30 support HDMI and the `7-inch Raspberry Pi touch display`_.

HDMI is working by default if you set `MACHINE=i300a-sb30`.
If you wish to use the 7-inch Raspberry Pi touch display,
you need to add the following to your `local.conf`:

.. code::

	KERNEL_DEVICETREE_OVERLAYS_AUTOLOAD += " \
		panel-raspberrypi.dtbo \
	"

Warning: Adding `panel-raspberrypi.dtbo` to KERNEL_DEVICETREE_OVERLAYS_AUTOLOAD
requires you to plug the 7-inch Raspberry Pi touch display to
the i300A SB30 board. Failing to connect it will prevent HDMI from working.
If you only want HDMI, you should not add `panel-raspberrypi.dtbo`.

MT7668 wireless chipset
------------------------

The i300A SB30 board is integrating
a :ref:`platforms/mt7668:MT7668 wireless chipset`.
By default the chipset comes with no MAC or BD address. Please refer to the
:ref:`platforms/mt7668:MT7668 wireless chipset` documentation to see how to
program a MAC or BD address.

Device-Tree Overlays (DTBO)
---------------------------

The following Device-Tree Overlays are supported:

* `panel-raspberrypi.dtbo`: Raspberry Pi touch display (see :ref:`boards/i300-pumpkin:Display` section)
