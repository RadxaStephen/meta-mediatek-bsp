# i300A SB30 Board

The SB30 is a development board made by Innocomm.

## Building

You can build an image for the Innocomm SB30 board by setting the
`MACHINE` variable in your `local.conf` to `i300a-sb30`.

	MACHINE=i300a-sb30

For full build instructions, please refer to the top level `README.md`.

## Display

The i300A SB30 support HDMI and the [7-inch Raspberry Pi touch display](https://www.raspberrypi.org/products/raspberry-pi-touch-display/).

HDMI is working by default if you set `MACHINE=i300a-sb30`. If you wish to use the 7-inch Raspberry Pi touch display, you need to add the following to your `local.conf`:

	KERNEL_DEVICETREE_OVERLAYS_AUTOLOAD += " \
		mt8167-sb30_rpi-display.dtbo \
	"

Warning: Adding `mt8167-sb30_rpi-display.dtbo` to KERNEL_DEVICETREE_OVERLAYS_AUTOLOAD requires you to plug the 7-inch Raspberry Pi touch display to the i300A SB30 board. Failing to connect it will prevent HDMI from working. If you only want HDMI, you should not add `mt8167-sb30_rpi-display.dtbo`.

## Device-Tree Overlays (DTBO)

The following Device-Tree Overlays are supported:
* `mt8167-sb30_rpi-display.dtbo`: Raspberry Pi touch display (see [Displays](#displays) section)
